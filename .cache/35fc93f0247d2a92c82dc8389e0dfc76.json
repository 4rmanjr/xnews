When we decompile these files (called APKs, in the case of Android apps), we\u2019re able to see various lines of code within that hint at possible future features. Keep in mind that Google may or may not ever ship these features, and our interpretation of what they are may be imperfect. We\u2019ll try to enable those that are closer to being finished, however, to show you how they\u2019ll look in case that they do ship. With that in mind, read on.\nWith the launch of Gemini 3 Pro in November, Google introduced the concept of \u201cLabs\u201d features like Gemini Agent, Dynamic View, and Visual layout.\nLabs that you can opt into to test upcoming features are coming to the Gemini app on Android. Google app 17.2 reveals work on four capabilities, starting with:\n- Live Thinking Mode: \u201cTry a version of Gemini Live that takes time to think and provide more detailed responses.\u201d\n- Live Experimental Features: \u201cTry our cutting-edge features: multimodal memory, better noise handling, responding when it sees something, and personalized results based on your Google apps.\u201d\nLive today is powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash. Those two Labs suggest that Gemini Live will soon be powered by Gemini 3. Live Thinking Mode could be using either the Thinking or Pro models for its \u201cmore detailed responses.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the Live Experimental Features are capabilities offered in the chat experience with Gemini 3 Flash and Pro. This includes Personal Intelligence\u2019s Connected Apps and Past Gemini chats. Better noise cancellation is always needed, while \u201cresponding when it sees something\u201d could be a Project Astra capability.\nThe other Labs features are:\n- UI Control: \u201cAgent controls phone to complete tasks\u201d\n- Deep Research: \u201cDelegate complex research tasks\u201d\nWe\u2019re unsure what the last item is specifically about, but we\u2019ve long been expecting Gemini Agent to come to Android as part of Computer Use.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
